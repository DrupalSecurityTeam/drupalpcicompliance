<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document provides a high level overview regarding Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance specifically for Drupal eCommerce solutions. The intended audiences include: Drupal developers; companies providing Drupal products, services, and hosting; and businesses evaluating Drupal as part of their eCommerce solution. Goals of this document: to emphasize the importance of PCI compliance; to summarize the options available in becoming and maintaining compliant; to provide clear next steps and additional resources.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>eCommerce volume continues to grow by double digit percentages each year<sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup> as more and more businesses are supplementing their existing revenue models and/or creating new streams <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. Simultaneously, Drupal has seen a 32% rise in the number of reported eCommerce installations in the last year across its very large installation base <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Drupal is an attractive eCommerce platform for many reasons: Its Open Source license eliminates one time and recurring costs to own and use, it is extremely modular and flexible, and it has a large, passionate, and world wide community that is continually contributing to and growing the platform. The Drupal community also makes a concerted effort when it comes to ensuring the platform is secure. There is a security team, weekly security advisories, venues to discuss security best practices, a collection of tools to help detect security vulnerabilities, etc.  The result is that Drupal is one of the most secure content management and eCommerce solutions available to merchants today.</p>

<p>However, while it is possible to make a Drupal-based eCommerce environment PCI DSS compliant through proper planning, usage, and management, the mere use of Drupal by itself is <em>IS NOT</em> sufficient to ensure the level of security necessary to become compliant. First, it’s possible to make Drupal insecure through the use of inappropriate configurations and site mismanagement. Second, Drupal is only a single component of the cardholder data environment (CDE). Hosting servers, networks, and other factors play a significant role in securing the entire end-to-end process. </p>

<p>How and where the credit card data is processed, transmitted, and stored determines the size, complexity, and risk associated with the cardholder data environment, which directly impacts the time, resources, and expertise required to achieve and maintain compliance. Whenever possible, wholly-outsourced and shared-management implementations can make it significantly easier to complete this process. Merchant-managed solutions can quickly become cost prohibitive for all but enterprise level companies, and should be avoided unless the business needs simply require them.</p>

<p>Regardless of the selected approach, it’s always necessary to adhere to the complete PCI DSS standard because a single exploit can undermine a company&#39;s PCI compliance, thereby opening it up to the financial and legal liabilities associated if a breach were to occur. Finally, the standard is only becoming more stringent; therefore, what is optional today is likely to become a requirement in the near future.</p>

<h2>Why Does PCI Compliance Matter for Drupal?</h2>

<p>PCI compliance is important for the industry as a whole as well as companies specifically using Drupal as part of their eCommerce solution. Here are several key areas to underscore the recommendation and requirement to adhere to PCI compliance.</p>

<h3>Trust</h3>

<p>Online credit card transactions have become so common and accepted in our society that it&#39;s easy to forget what is at stake. When a thief goes after physical credit cards the amount of financial loss is limited in size and quantity because each card has to be stolen one by one. However in the case of electronic payments, a single thief can potentially breach multiple websites with the same exploit and steal hundreds, thousands, or even millions of credit cards. The financial loss by the number of people affected in a website compromise can be staggering.</p>

<p>While these scenarios do in fact happen, their frequency is far outweighed by the volume of transactions that are handled securely. This is in part because of the set of security standards set forth by the Payment Card Industry. When properly applied, the risk level for transactions goes down significantly, which leads to more consumer trust in merchants, the process, and the industry as a whole can continue to expand. However, if this trust is broken, consumers will lose this confidence and seek other merchants and means of payment.</p>

<h3>Privilege</h3>

<p>Using credit cards is a privilege, not a right. The Payment Card Industry has established a system of payment that is convenient for consumers and business owners who choose not to deal in checks and cash. It is their system and they get to set the requirements. Anyone accepting online payments must sign a contract and/or accept a terms of use agreement that explicitly states the merchants responsibility to adhere to these requirements (unfortunately this isn&#39;t always emphasized in the sign up process, so be sure to read through the fine print). Therefore, simply installing a Drupal site to accept credit card payments doesn’t mean you have established the proper means of doing so.</p>

<h3>Distributed Components</h3>

<p>Every component between a customer’s browser window and the payment processor makes up the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). If one only focuses on securing a single component, the weakest link in the chain can be the source of an exploit. Therefore it’s not enough to simply secure Drupal. The PCI standard provides guidance on how to make sure all components are secured.</p>

<p><em>Authors Note: It&#39;s important to note that ALL systems connected to the same network that&#39;s behind the same stateful firewall as the eCommerce server are also considered part of the CDE. Therefore, a common strategy is to segment the network such that only the eCommerce relevant components are together in a carefully protected network, thus reducing the overall scope for PCI DSS compliance.</em></p>

<h3>Distributed Companies</h3>

<p>It’s not common for one company to control the entire end-to-end process of handing a credit card transaction. Therefore, it’s important to know how exactly how these companies distribute the responsibility as well as liability for ensuring this process is secure. </p>

<h3>Financial</h3>

<p>If you ever face a security breach and credit card information is stolen, having a proven record of your PCI compliance can protect you from the financial penalties (ranging from $25 to $215 per compromised card<sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>). Major corporations, such as Heartland Payment Systems, have faced fines as large as $12.5 million<sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Small companies are equally at risk, accounting for 80% of all instances of unauthorized access<sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>. Finally, any company that has a reported breach on their record must undergo mandatory ROC audits, which alone can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<h3>Public Relations</h3>

<p>Beyond the financial burden of dealing with a breach, the loss of trust for ones website, business, and brand can be staggering. The Sony PlayStation breach put more than 77 million credit card numbers at risk <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. The ramifications of alerting and requiring that many users to change their cards and/or put a freeze on their credit cards can quickly lose current and future customers. These transactions can also impact customer credit scores if they unknowingly overdraft or miss a payment they were not expecting.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>While developers and businesses may see this standard as a nuisance, it’s important to realize that these standards allow this industry as a whole to provide the level of security and trust necessary to keep it growing. The PCI DSS should be considered a baseline, minimal level of security for sites handling sensitive information - your site very well may need security controls that exceed this standard. Also adhering to the standards helps ensure protection for the business (legal, PR, and financial), as well as your customers (legal, financial). </p>

<h2>The Standard Itself</h2>

<p><em>Note: This paper specifically excludes PA-DSS because Drupal is Open Source Software and (whether right or wrong) falls outside the PA-DSS standard.</em></p>

<p>The PCI-DSS standard covers 12 requirements across 5 overarching categories<sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. Rather than restate what is already provided in the materials from the PCI council, the focus here is to specifically identify why each requirement directly affects the security of Drupal within the context of a complete CDE.</p>

<h3>Requirement 1. Install and Maintain a Firewall</h3>

<p>The integrity of a Drupal code base can only be maintained if access to the server is restricted and protected by a stateful firewall. A lax or nonexistent firewall policy provides more ways for an attacker to find a vulnerability, gain access to the server, and modify the code on the system, which opens the door for harvesting credit card numbers.</p>

<h3>Requirement 2. Do Not Use Vendor Supplied Default Passwords</h3>

<p>This should be obvious, but any component of your system that has a known default password can be vulnerable if it’s not reset immediately. A Drupal specific example is the Commerce Kickstart installation profile. By default, it sets the super admin username and password to “admin.” This should only be used for testing/evaluation purposes and should never be used for a live site.</p>

<h3>Requirement 3. Protect Stored Data</h3>

<p>Ideally credit cards are not being stored on a Drupal website at all. If they are stored, they must be encrypted in such a manner that anything with access to the database, server, or network cannot decode the information in a manner that is not intended. Achieving this is non-trivial and should only be attempted after gaining close familiarity with the PCI SAQ D standard.</p>

<h3>Requirement 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks</h3>

<p>The data leaving the Drupal application travels through many routers and networks on the way to the payment processor. Unencrypted data would allow any component along that path to copy cardholder data and other sensitive information. Therefore, encryption with a trusted SSL certificate is a must.</p>

<h3>Requirement 5. Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs</h3>

<p>If malware is installed on a server running Drupal, it can be difficult or impossible to verify the integrity of the codebase, which opens the door for access to credit card data.</p>

<h3>Requirement 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications</h3>

<p>It’s simply not enough to “set it and forget it” when it comes to all components of the CDE. A single discovered vulnerability at the network, server, and/or Drupal app layer has the potential for exploitation.  Drupal security advisories are posted every Wednesday and should be watched regularly for any updates affecting Drupal core and/or contributed modules.  Likewise, critical Operating System and support software (Apache, PHP, MySQL, etc.) patches must be applied within 30 days of release.  </p>

<h3>Requirement 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know</h3>

<p>This requirement impacts not only application design, but also account and server management. For example, the server that houses your eCommerce site should not be used as a place where anyone can connect via FTP using a shared password and upload photos from the company picnic. Any one of those individuals’ machines could be used to gain authorized access to the CDE code base and/or card data itself.</p>

<h3>Requirement 8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access</h3>

<p>Sharing usernames and passwords leaves less detail for actions occurring for each individual user. It also generally leads to other bad practices, such as creating weak passwords and sharing them over insecure channels like email.  Never share your “user 1” or root login information between staff.</p>

<h3>Requirement 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data</h3>

<p>Similar to Requirement 1, access to the server must be protected at all times. If a person without proper clearance can physically access a server, they can potentially gain root access and compromise the database and Drupal app layer. If you outsource hosting, ensure the provider is PCI DSS compliant.</p>

<h3>Requirement 10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data</h3>

<p>Audit trails are critical for identifying changes in the system because a single code or configuration alteration can open up a security vulnerability. Having the ability to identify exactly what changed and who changed it is very important for verifying the integrity of a system.</p>

<h3>Requirement 11. Regularly test security systems and processes</h3>

<p>It’s not enough to have a system that works in theory. Periodic vulnerability scans full penetration tests are necessary to prove that the system responds as expected. These tests have to be run regularly (at least quarterly) and are ideally run whenever there is a configuration or code change that could introduce a new vulnerability. Ensure you are using an officially Authorized Scanning Vendor (ASV) as listed on the PCI site<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Requirement 12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel</h3>

<p>All the hardware testing, security scans, and audits in the world will not help if people are allowed to use insecure passwords or send full credit card numbers via unencrypted channels like email. The human element is often the weakest link in the security chain. A security policy is required to ensure ALL employees know and understand what is acceptable and what is not with respect to maintaining compliance.</p>

<h2>Self-Assessment Questionnaire</h2>

<p>Knowing how to get started can seem overwhelming at first. Thankfully, the PCI council has provided detailed reference guides and instructions<sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. All of these materials culminate to what is called your Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). This form is essentially a checklist that you must complete and adhere to in order to obtain and maintain PCI compliance.</p>

<p>Your credit card processor and acquiring bank are required to ask you for annual SAQ forms - if they haven’t asked yet, they will soon!</p>

<p>The key is determining which SAQ you should be filling out because they vary wildly in terms of quantity of responsibilities and the amount of time and effort it takes to complete them. SAQ A has as few as 15 items and can be completed fairly quickly. SAQ D contains over 288 items and can take months of time and millions of dollars to achieve. The following section will help you make sense of these different levels and how you can select the method that balances your business needs with your ability to achieve compliance.
Determining Your Responsibilities
The quantity and difficulty of your PCI responsibilities are a result of your merchant level (which is based on the volume of transactions) and your validation type (which is based on how you’re conducting transactions).
Merchant Level
The PCI council has defined 4 levels of transaction volume (Figure 1)</p>

<p><img src="images/figures/PCI-levels-visa-cardbrand-2013-06-10.png" alt="" title="A table showing the 4 levels of PCI compliance transaction volumes for VISA card brand."></p>

<p><em>Figure 1. The 4 levels of transaction volumes for VISA card brand. Other card brands (e.g. MasterCard, American Express, etc.) have different reporting and validation requirements. Image Source  http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk<em>management/cisp</em>merchants.html</em></p>

<p>There are a few important points to emphasize for the Visa card brand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compliance begins at transaction #1.</li>
<li>Even though validation is optional at level 4, compliance is still mandatory.</li>
<li>If a breach occurs and is reported, a company immediately moves to level 1 regardless of its transaction volume.</li>
<li>Level 1 validation involves more stringent auditing process, including a mandated third-party audit, which adds additional time and money to stay compliant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validation Type</h3>

<p>The PCI council defines 5 different validation types:</p>

<p><img src="images/figures/PCI-saq-breakdown.png" alt="" title="Breakdown of PCI types as a function of merchant’s activities."></p>

<p><em>Figure 2. Breakdown of PCI types as a function of merchant’s activities.</em></p>

<p>For the purposes of a typical Drupal eCommerce site, the SAQ A, C, and D are the most relevant types<sup><a href="#footnote-A">A</a>, <a href="#footnote-B">B</a></sup>. It is also extremely important to understand which type the system falls into because there is a large difference in time, effort, risk, and expense in achieving compliance.</p>

<p><img src="images/figures/PCI-typical-costs-per-saq-type.png" alt="" title="Approximate PCI compliance costs per SAQ type. Factors include audits ($30,000-$100,000), time spent meeting each requirement, etc."></p>

<p><em>Figure 3. Approximate PCI compliance costs per SAQ type. Factors include audits ($30,000-$100,000), time spent meeting each requirement, etc.</em></p>

<p>For many smaller eCommerce stores, selecting a payment method that places them in type C or D can be cost prohibitive. However, achieving type A is not always possible given a businesses features and requirements, which drives the expansion or reduction of the CDE and ultimately determines the validation type. </p>

<h3>Drupal Specific Examples</h3>

<p>The shopping cart selected (Drupal Commerce, Ubercart, Pay, Stripe, etc.) and the payment method within that shopping cart (hosted payment page, direct post, iframe, onsite, etc.) are usually the most significant factors in expanding or reducing the CDE, which directly impacts the SAQ type. Here are some situations that may force one into SAQ C/D:</p>

<ul>
<li>A client that wants complete control over the checkout process may shy away from hosted payment pages, which may be the only viable shared-management option for a particular payment gateway<sup><a href="#footnote-C">C</a></sup>.</li>
<li>A client sometimes must use a particular payment gateway because of an existing contract/business relationship, and that gateway may offer no shared-management options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview of Payment Methods</h2>

<p>The PCI council defines 3 types of payment methods: Merchant-managed, Shared-management, and Wholly-outsourced.</p>

<h3>Merchant-managed</h3>

<p>A general guideline is that if the company’s servers store, transmit, or handle cardholder data, then it’s merchant managed. An example would be customer submitting a payment directly on a Drupal site using Ubercart connected to Authorize.Net because a customer’s payment information passes through merchant’s webserver on the way to being sent to Authorize.Net.</p>

<p>Onsite payments posted directly back to Drupal immediately fall into SAQ C. If additional features are required (such as stored credit card numbers), the CDE scope expands further to SAQ D.</p>

<p>Merchant-managed examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authorize.Net Automated Recurring Billing (ARB)</li>
<li>Authorize.Net Customer Information Manager (CIM)</li>
<li>PayPal Payments Standard (PPS)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shared-management</h3>

<p>In a shared management approach, the credit card information never touches the server that is running the Drupal application. This is generally accomplished by one of 3 approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hosted Payment Page (HPP)</li>
<li>Direct Post</li>
<li>iFrame</li>
</ul>

<p>A HPP approach is where a user is redirected from a Drupal site to a third-party site in order to enter their payment details. If the transaction is successful, the customer is redirected back to the Drupal site with an authorization code that validates the payment was accepted.</p>

<p>Example HPP solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authorize.Net Server Integration Method (SIM)</li>
<li>PayPal Payments Standard (PPS)</li>
<li>PayPal Express Checkout (EC)</li>
</ul>

<p>A direct post approach is where the customer remains on the website, but the payment form is submitted directly from the customer’s browser to the payment gateway and a response is sent directly back to the customer with an authentication code that is then submitted to the Drupal application.</p>

<p>Example direct post solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authorize.Net Direct Post Method (DPM)</li>
<li>Braintree Payments</li>
<li>Stripe</li>
</ul>

<p>An iframe approach is where the payment details portion of the checkout form is loaded through an iframe directly from the payment processor. Similar to a direct post strategy, an iframe gives the customer the impression they are always on site while the credit card details are sent directly to the payment gateway.</p>

<p>Example iframe solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hosted PCI </li>
<li>Authorize.Net Hosted Customer Information Manager (CIM)</li>
<li>PayPal Payments Advanced (PPA)</li>
<li>PayPal Payflow Link (PFL)</li>
</ul>

<p>The common denominator in all shared-management configurations is that the checkout process begins on a CDE managed by the company, but the customer is technically sending their credit card credentials directly to the payment processor’s CDE. This occurs by redirection (HPP), loading a payment form from their servers (iframe), or posting the form directly through JavaScript or the action attribute on an HTML form (direct post).</p>

<p>One might assume that a shared-management approach would qualify them for SAQ A. However, section 3.4.3 in the PCI DSS eCommerce Guidelines Supplement document makes it clear that SAQ C considerations are still applicable because each shared management method has vulnerabilities <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. Example, a security breach on the Drupal application could be used to modify the Drupal codebase to load an iframe hosted by a server collecting credit card numbers.</p>

<p>Frustrating as this may be for those wanting to achieve PCI SAQ A, the good news is that using a shared management system still makes it significantly easier and faster to obtain compliance in SAQ C because a significant amount of the responsibility can still be considered outsourced.</p>

<h3>Wholly Outsourced</h3>

<p>In a wholly outsourced solution, everything regarding the Drupal application is hosted, managed, and under the responsibility (emphasis added) by a third-party vendor. Please note that most hosting services and Drupal vendors do not explicitly take on that responsibility, so be sure to do your due diligence and ensure that they are equally aware of the repercussions of taking on that responsibility. If the third-party vendor does take on that responsibility, you may be eligible for completing SAQ A<sup><a href="#footnote-D">D</a></sup>. </p>

<h3>Version 2.0 Disclaimer</h3>

<p>It is important to note that the information contained in this paper applies only to version 2.0 of the PCI standard. The 3.0 standard (due out as early as Fall 2013) is likely to make it more explicit for all shared management solutions to require SAQ C, and the SAQ C standard itself may become more stringent. Therefore it is highly recommended to adhere to SAQ C unless in a wholly outsourced environment.</p>

<h2>Selecting the Appropriate Method</h2>

<p>SAQ A is obviously desirable (and recommended) because of its low risk, time, and cost to implement. However, a company’s business needs may require a solution that is more customizable and that may rule out a wholly outsourced or even shared management solution.</p>

<h3>Example: Recurring Payments for Ubercart on Drupal 7</h3>

<p>As of the time of this writing, there is no wholly-outsourced or shared-management solution for a Drupal 7 website using Ubercart with a recurring billing requirement. To store a customer’s credit card information directly on Authorize.Net’s servers, one must use the included Ubercart Authorize.Net module and enable the customer information manager (CIM) option. Unfortunately, the way Ubercart implements CIM  requires the credit card information to pass through the Drupal application. Therefore this is a Merchant-managed solution, which requires one to adhere to every control item in SAQ C.</p>

<p><em>Authors Note: payment processors like Authorize.Net have the ability to use third-party iframes to integrate with their CIM service. However, the Ubercart community is unlikely to add that feature into its code base<sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</em></p>

<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>

<p>One of the easiest ways to use a shared-management approach is to redirect to a hosted payment page. However, website owners are often resistant to doing this because customers are not always keen on being sent to a third-party site. Additionally, third-party HPPs are not always as customizable in terms of look and feel. Finally, HPP solutions are often more difficult to develop against because one needs to be developing on a public facing URL or IP address in order to get the response back appropriately.</p>

<p>With respect to direct post methods using JavaScript (JS), there is always the consideration that a user may have disabled JS by default and therefore be unable to enter a payment at all without prompting them to adjust their browser security settings.</p>

<p>There are considerations with respect to which shopping cart method one will use (or is using) on top of Drupal. While Drupal Commerce is clearly going to win out in the long run, there is still a significant user base using Ubercart. The issue with Ubercart is that it has far fewer shared-management options. The additional costs of becoming compliant with Ubercart should be a consideration when evaluating the two solutions. </p>

<p>There are also other payment methods on Drupal, such as the stand alone Stripe and Pay modules, which offer a simpler and smaller feature set than Ubercart and Drupal Commerce and may be more appropriate for one time payment solutions. </p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution because each company will have to balance the resources available with becoming compliant with the features necessary for the business. However, there are some general recommendations that apply across the board. The first is to use Drupal Commerce over Ubercart because Drupal Commerce has more developer focus on it and has a more consistent code base. It also has more Shared-management payment solutions, and that trend is likely to continue. Finally, whenever possible, use a shared-management solution because it will significantly reduce costs and risk and get a site as close to PCI SAQ A as possible.</p>

<h2>Drupal Specific Exploits</h2>

<p>To further emphasize the importance of adhering to the PCI standard (for both merchant-managed and shared-management payment solutions), we created a list of the many ways in which a compromised website could be configured in order to steal cardholder data.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct module manipulation.</strong> The codebase could be altered in such a way to email, log, or display cardholder data upon form submission.</li>
<li><strong>Hook alters.</strong> Any module could implement a form alter hook to add in additional validation and/or submission functions to grab the cardholder data.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting language.</strong> A Flash or JavaScript keylogger or scraper could be used to harvest information as they are typing it in and sending it to an external server.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS disabling.</strong> A single configuration change can remove HTTPS and user data would be passed unencrypted.</li>
<li><strong>Changing credentials.</strong> Hackers could substitute in their own gateway credentials to collect information into a different account.</li>
<li><strong>Modifying a direct post.</strong> Modification of the form action or JavaScript code could send the payment information to an alternative server that harvests cardholder data.</li>
<li><strong>Modifying an iframe.</strong> Modification of the iframe code could be set to load a payment form from another website acting as a man in the middle attack.</li>
<li><strong>Modifying a Hosted Payment Page.</strong> Modification of the hosted payment page URL could redirect a customer to an alternative version of the payment site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Locking Down Drupal for PCI SAQ C/D</h2>

<p>This is a non-exhaustive list of ways in which you can harden security at the Drupal level.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PCI ASV Scans.</strong> The results will alert you to areas of the site you may have looked over.</li>
<li><strong>Hacked module.</strong> This module will download a copy of each module and run a diff against them to ensure the code matches what was provided from Drupal.org.</li>
<li><strong>MD5 Check module.</strong> This module will run a checksum of each module and provide a security alert if anything has changed.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy full codebase with each release.</strong> This will ensure that any tampered files get replaced.</li>
<li><strong>Storing security configurations in code.</strong> Example: one can force secure pages to always be enabled by adding its system variables into the settings.php.</li>
<li><strong>Removing credentials from settings.php.</strong> One can include a settings.local.php file within settings.php to ensure that sensitive information is not distributed.</li>
<li><strong>Security Updates.</strong> Always keep up with the Drupal Security Advisories, which are released every Wednesday.</li>
<li><strong>Paranoia and Security Review Modules.</strong> The modules provide and review your Drupal configurations to ensure they adhere to best security practices.</li>
<li><strong>Holistic approach to compliance.</strong> Consider PCI DSS compliance as part of the bigger picture of your organization’s compliance requirements.  Often organizations will have overlapping compliance requirements from standards such as NIST 800-53, ISO27002, HIPAA, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drupal’s Security Team</h2>

<p>The Drupal security team is a volunteer group of developers who are passionate about keeping Drupal secure. You can follow them by visiting http://drupal.org/security, subscribing to their RSS feeds, joining their group on groups.drupal.org, etc.</p>

<h2>Final Message to Drupal Developers</h2>

<p>The security of a website largely depends on the quality of your work and your attention to detail. Whenever creating custom code, be sure that it complies with best practices. When using other people’s code, be sure to review it to ensure that it is also stable, secure, and community supported. When configuring a site, be sure to leverage modules like Security Review and Coder Review to ensure you are not accidentally opening up a security hole.</p>

<p>While you are not necessarily the one responsible for achieving and maintaining a site’s PCI compliance, you are responsible for educating yourself about it as well as notifying your employer and/or client when their decisions will impact the site’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2>Final Message to Drupal Shops</h2>

<p>Your responsibility is to protect your business. It is up to you to be exceedingly clear with respect to who is responsible for PCI compliance before, during, and after a site launch. Any service agreements should also include language regarding each party&#39;s responsibilities as well as links to reference materials that provide clients with a means of understanding the implications of these responsibilities.</p>

<p>This conversation will ultimately lead to a greater focus on security for all delivered websites. This not only can be valuable upsell to current clients, but it can become a competitive advantage and even attract new business.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are a service provider that offers hosting or managed services for a site that handles credit cards and you agree to take on the PCI DSS responsibilities for your clients, you must comply with all PCI DSS requirements and complete SAQ D as a Service Provider, no matter what shopping cart solutions your clients have implemented.</p>

<h2>Final Message to Site Owners</h2>

<p>Your decisions about how you handle credit card data affect the livelihood of your business. While achieving PCI compliance may seem cost prohibitive, the reality is that a security breach could potentially bankrupt a small- to medium-size business. Beyond that, the decisions you make also affect the credit of your customers because identity theft can cost thousands of dollars and take months to years to reconcile. Finally, there can be legal and PR consequences that occur as a result of a breach, further affecting your ability to sustain and grow your business.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Getting started can seem like a daunting task. However, breaking it down into small steps can make this a very manageable process.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Assess current setup.</strong> Questions to ask: Do you have a site already or are you starting from scratch? Are you using Drupal Commerce or Ubercart? Are you willing to migrate between them if necessary?</li>
<li><strong>Assess requirements.</strong> Questions to ask: Which is more important: cost or features? Do you need any complex interactions or feature sets during checkout? Or can you suffice with using a PayPal button and calling it a day?</li>
<li><strong>Reduce CDE Scope.</strong> Questions to ask: Is it possible to segment your network so that non-related servers are not maintained behind the same stateful firewalls as your eCommerce servers?</li>
<li><strong>Assess options.</strong> Now that you know what you have to work with and what the goals are, evaluate the cost/effort/risk of 2-3 scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Decide on a method.</strong> Ultimately the business owner must ultimately pick a specific method balancing all the factors.</li>
<li><strong>Determine responsibilities.</strong> Once a decision is made, it’s time to clearly articulate who is responsible for what at each stage in the development cycle. There should also be clear sign off points established.</li>
<li><strong>Complete the relevant SAQ:</strong> The Self Assessment Questionnaire is your key tool for performing a gap analysis and determining whether you are currently compliant. </li>
<li><strong>Prioritize PCI responsibilities.</strong> Becoming compliant can take a long time, but some responsibilities are more critical than others. The PCI industry created a document title The Prioritized Approach to Pursue PCI DSS Compliance, which gives clear guidance on what should be done first to minimize risk during the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>Create plan and execute.</strong> Once you’ve identified what needs to be done and created a plan, it’s time to make consistent progress toward checking off items on the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>At any stage, you also may wish to hire a professional to help expedite the process and ensure that your plan is sound. Specifically, you would want to locate a QSA (Qualified Security Assessor), which are organizations specifically “ordained” by the PCI Council to interpret and audit against the PCI DSS.</p>

<h2>Top 8 Drupal PCI Compliance Myths</h2>

<p><em>Author’s Note: This is a trimmed down summary from a longer article that will be published soon.</em></p>

<h3>Drupal is PCI compliant.</h3>

<p>This is incorrect by itself because Drupal is only one piece of the cardholder data environment (CDE). However, Drupal (when it’s up to date with all of its security patches and when it’s configured properly) can help one achieve compliance more easily through the use of various contributed modules, such as Paranoia and Security Review.</p>

<h3>Ubercart and Drupal Commerce are PCI compliant.</h3>

<p>This is also incorrect in and of itself simply because it’s a component of a large system. However, the particular payment method chosen within each eCommerce solution can greatly influence how easy it is to become compliant.</p>

<h3>I use HTTPS, therefore my Drupal website is secure.</h3>

<p>Securing the transaction from the Drupal application to the payment gateway addresses only one of the 12 sections of the PCI standard. There are a significant number of other vulnerabilities that can exist at the server, network, and application level,</p>

<h3>I can store numbers/CCV.</h3>

<p>Storing the 3-4 digit security code is never allowed under any circumstances. Storing the full credit card number at the Drupal layer is extremely risky and should not be done without a considerable amount of attention.</p>

<h3>Shared-management Methods are 100% Foolproof</h3>

<p>This is false because modifying code at the Drupal application layer can result in a man in the middle attack, the introduction of a keylogger, etc.</p>

<h3>I can achieve PCI compliance using shared hosting.</h3>

<p>Shared hosting is simply not secure enough for PCI SAQ C because there are simply too many users (both customers and employees of the hosting company) that have access to the server and you simply do not have enough control in locking down the system.</p>

<h3>I can achieve PCI compliance using cloud hosting.</h3>

<p>Even reputable companies like Rackspace make it very clear that you must use their managed, non-cloud based servers because their cloud based offerings have not been certified to adhere to the requirements necessary to achieve PCI Level 1 compliance at the hardware level<sup><a href="#cite-15">15</a></sup>. The only major cloud hosting company that offers this is AWS. In all cases you must us a PCI DSS certified service provider if you are outsourcing hosting for eCommerce servers.</p>

<h3>I can set it and forget it.</h3>

<p>PCI compliance is not a single event that is checked off a list and never revisited. Rather, it’s a continually changing state. If a security exploit is discovered and disclosed for Drupal or the OS running the server Drupal is hosted on, then your site is not PCI compliant. Therefore PCI compliance is a continual process that needs to be maintained through vigilance. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Drupal makes it trivial to get an eCommerce site up in minutes, PCI compliance can take months if not setup correctly. And while PCI compliance has many nuances and complexities, it’s a mandatory requirement for the 10’s of thousands of reported Drupal eCommerce installations. Small, incremental steps in learning and implementation are key in achieving and maintaining compliance, protecting your business, customers, and development.</p>
