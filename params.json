{"name":"Proposal: Drupal PCI Compliance White Paper","tagline":"This page is currently a placeholder for the completed Drupal PCI compliance white paper, which will be maintained here.","body":"###Motivation\r\n\r\nDrupal.org reports over 67,000+ active Ubercart and Drupal Commerce installations. With such a large and active portion of our community involved in eCommerce, one would expect an equal amount of effort and resources being applied towards helping these websites achieve the mandatory security standards set forth by the Payment Card Industry (PCI).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a definitive guide or comprehensive resources simply doesn’t exist. Instead, there are just a handful of articles, forum threads, and videos; most of these resources are fragmented, outdated, and riddled with inaccurate information. Worse yet, Google reports that there are only 100-200 keyword searches a month for “Drupal PCI compliance” and other variations. This is extremely low considering that PCI compliance typically takes months of time and resources to both research and implement.\r\n\r\nFailing to become PCI compliant exposes businesses to legal and financial liabilities. It can also exposes Drupal to PR issues, where a breach in security can easily lead to “Drupal is insecure” thinking. This should be a huge concern for the Drupal community as a whole, which prides itself in having a strong focus on security as well as one of the world’s most secure open source CMSs.\r\nProposed Solution\r\n\r\nThe source of all these issues stems from a lack of accurate, accessible, and easily understandable information specifically targeting members of the Drupal Community. Therefore we propose the following:\r\n\r\n* Deliverable: A white paper focused specifically on PCI compliance for Ubercart and Drupal Commerce.\r\n* Size: 10-15 pages 1.5 spaced.\r\n* Format: Similar to the Drupal Security Report.\r\n* License: Creative Commons Attribution No-derivatives (keeps your name in the report)\r\n* Target Audience: Drupal developers, shops, and evaluators.\r\n* Location 1: Hosted on DrupalPCICompliance.org\r\n* Location 2: Linked from Ubercart/Drupal Commerce project pages\r\n* Location 3: Linked from Commerce Guys (pending their approval).\r\n\r\nThis report would be created by Rick Manelius with help from Greg Knaddison. Rick has over 3.5 years worth of experience with helping paywall/membership sites achieve PCI compliance and is fast becoming an expert on the topic in the community. Greg is a published author and leader in the realm of security in Drupal who works for CARD.com, the only financial service company built completely on Drupal.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThe content of the 1.0 version of this paper is almost complete. We are still waiting for our feedback from reviewers, assets from sponsors, etc. Now it's a matter of packaging it all up in the appropriate formats and releasing the initial version to the public, where we'll await for feedback and produce a 1.1 version.\r\n\r\n### Sponsorship\r\n\r\nIf you have received this, we are specifically contacting you to become a sponsor to fund this project so the authors can provide a quality deliverable within the proposed timeline. Sponsors will receive permanent placement of their name + logo within the report as well as placement on the primary hosting location. This will include the print copy to be distributed at DrupalCon Portland (again, pending acceptance of this session).\r\n\r\nGold Sponsor ($1000, 8 spots total)\r\nSilver Sponsor ($500, 4 spots total)\r\n\r\nIf you’re ready to become a sponsor or volunteer, please see the contact information below.\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nRick Manelius - email: rickmanelius@gmail.com (preferred) - phone: 617-970-1414\r\n \r\n[Drupal](https://drupal.org) is a registered trademark of [Dries Buytaert](http://buytaert.net/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
